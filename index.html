<blockquote>
<p>The Reddiquette we have sworn to protect and defend in this constitution tells us not to whine about reposts. Therefore a repost itself is NOT a "crime" but useful for the uninitiated.</p>

<p>You should keep in mind that there are lots of things that may not be wrong or disallowed, but that doesn't mean you should take advantage of that.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fLpktf2jYw">Here's a super duper fantastically awesome catchy song to help learn reddiquette.</a></p>

<h3>
<a name="-a-filing-of-charges" class="anchor" href="#-a-filing-of-charges"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>ยง A. Filing of Charges</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Plaintiffs may file any applicable charges (listed or unlisted) and bring their evidence before the court in the form of a post to /r/KarmaCourt. The Defendant can be served a summons, and attorneys can begin preparing their cases, but no charges are official until a duly appointed judge calls the case to order. Once charges are filed, both sides may request an attorney. Any redditor can serve as an attorney.</p>

<blockquote>
<h4>
<a name="-a2-finding-a-judge" class="anchor" href="#-a2-finding-a-judge"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>ยง A2. Finding A Judge</h4>

<p><strong>Judges must have passed the bar exam to be judge.</strong> Any KCA bar certified attorney can be a judge as long as they have participated in the KC community enough to know how it works. A month is the minimum:  </p>

<p>If youยดre really crap you will be removed.  </p>

<p>You have to make sure the case doesn't become inactive.</p>

<p>It is required that you are not a dick, or display dickish behavior as a judge.</p>

<p>The JUSTICES of KC retain the right to intervene in a case and take the judgeship responsibilities if they find a judge is not properly doing his/her job.</p>

<h4>
<a name="-a3-finding-an-attorney" class="anchor" href="#-a3-finding-an-attorney"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>ยง A3. Finding an Attorney</h4>

<p>An attorney can be quite useful as they can assist you in representing yourself in the courts. They also are responsible for building a case against the opposing party and questioning evidence/witnesses for you. Any Redditor, as long as they have a good sense of procedures, can be an attorney. If anyone feels they need an attorney who has a considerable amount of experience in the courts, the Karma Court Attorneyโs Office at /r/KarmaCourtAttorneys would be glad to assist anyone in need of an attorney. Redditors who are also interested in becoming an attorney can also go to /r/KarmaCourtAttorneys and become a K-BAR certified attorney either as a full, prosecutor, or defense.</p>

<p>It is with great suggestion that the Court Stenographer maintain and follow the case records with great pride and diligence. An effective way of having a good case is to have effective formatting. A case should have a case number for record keeping. Listing the last two digits of the year, KCC, a dash with the two digit month, and a dash with the 5 characters from the URL found after the /comments/ portion of the URL. It would look like 13KCC-10-1VTG5. The stenographer would also include the description of the crimes committed, evidence, as well as members involved (Judge, Prosecution, Jury, etc). If the stenographer wishes to include news as well as any other information they feel that should be broadcasted, they may do so. Each stenographer has their own style of formatting.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are many Karma Crimes that can occur while browsing Reddit.  The following are common examples of crimes.  Do not feel limited to these crimes only.  The overseeing judge has the final word in establishing a sentence. Charges remain open to interpretation to pertain to a case at hand.  The charges listed below are often used as a precedent for future accusations and to better understand the cases.</p>

<blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>(1). Douchebaggery - When one is being a douche.</p>

<p>(2). Defamation - Tarnishing another Redditor's username.</p>

<p>(3). Public Indecency - When a user flexes his or her 'e-peen' with the intent to shame other users.</p>

<p>(4). OhShit.exe - Intentional reposting that results in Reddit Gold.</p>

<p>(5). GrandTheft.jpg - Reposting while claiming credit for the post.</p>

<p>(6). Obstruction of Justice - Impeding or interfering with an investigation, such as submitting false screenshots, deleting evidence, or providing false evidence to the court.</p>

<p>(7). Trying to make people believe some crazy ex kidnapped your cat definitely a no-no. Fuck that. GUILTY!</p>

<p>(8). Other - Literally anything else you want.  We like creative names for charges.</p>

<p>No punishments other than being publically shamed and being told you suck at Reddit or politely told to go fuck oneself.</p>

<p><strong>/r/KarmaCourt is not here to downvote anyone, including those convicted, for anything other than irrelevancy.  Mass downvoting, as determined by a Justice, will be punishable with a ban, no warnings, no due process.</strong></p>

<p>/r/KarmaCourt is an independent subreddit.  The laws of KC are loose and defined for KC only.  Any subreddit has its own laws.

<p>Anyone can be an attorney in /r/KarmaCourt.  If you want more information or would like to become bar certified, check out /r/KarmaCourtAttorneys.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Do I need permission from the mods to start a case?</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>No.  You can bring charges at any time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>How do I get post flair?</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>OP of a case can add "Judge Needed" and "In Session" flair by clicking on the flair button underneath the post title.  Only Justices may choose the "Case Closed" flair.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>What do I do if I have been charged with a crime?</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Run for your life.  Haha no.  Find yourself a good defense attorney and start finding evidence to exonerate yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>What is the Gazette?</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Gazette, found at /r/KarmaCourtGazette, is the official newspaper for all things /r/KarmaCourt.  Like many newspaper's of our day, the Gazette has closed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>What is the KarmacourtBlog?</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The KCBlog, found at /r/KarmaCourtBlog, is the official media outlet for all things /r/KarmaCourt. Important information and high profile cases with up-to-date reports can be found here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Where can I find a lawyer for a case?</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have two options.  Either ask around in /r/KarmaCourt or head over to /r/KarmaCourtAttorneys and ask for one.  Look to the wiki page for a listing of KCA approved Law Firms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Can I be convicted of a crime that isn't on here?</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sure can.  The Constitution isn't a strict order.  It's a document that tries to portray how our court system works.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Is reposting a crime?</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>No.  In itself, there is nothing wrong with a repost.  Chances are half the stuff you see on reddit for the first time on any given day is a repost.  Make sure that the crime fits before you press charges.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Why should I press charges?</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because you're <em>internet bitter</em> and somebody stole your points that you can't cash in for anything.  It's all in good fun, but it's also fun to take things a little too far.  Key word, a little.  Just because you see a crime, does not mean you should report it.  There should be damages to you.  Nobody likes a whistle blower.  Or you can snitch, this is a document not a cop.</p>
