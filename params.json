The right to proper attribution of their post.\r\n>\r\n>2. The right to personal privacy, to not have their private information stolen, shared, or used for blackmail.\r\n>\r\n>3. The right to appeal, if he or she feels the verdict was unjust.\r\n>\r\n>4.

Ample time and notice should be given to the defendant before a judgement being laid down. This may be based on how recently the defendant may have been offline for, or how long ago the offending post was made. Each situation must be assessed individually by the presiding judge.\r\n>\r\n>6. Freedom from being down-voted as a result of differing opinions and/or actions made by a user.\r\n>\r\n>7.

The right to post on parody subreddits without persecution, such as /r/CircleJerk\r\n        \r\n###§ B. Reddiquette Clause###\r\n>\r\n>The Reddiquette we have sworn to protect and defend in this constitution tells us not to whine about reposts. Therefore a repost itself is NOT a \"crime\" but useful for the uninitiated.\r\n>\r\n>You should keep in mind that there are lots of things that may not be wrong or disallowed, but that doesn't mean you should take advantage of that.  [Here's a super duper fantastically awesome catchy song to help learn reddiquette.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fLpktf2jYw)\r\n\r\n###§ C. Doxxing Protection Clause###\r\n>\r\n>>To maintain a safe and protective environment, Karma Court **strictly** prohibits any personal information being published or shared, even if it has been already done, it does not need to happen again.\r\n>\r\n>1. Link to Social Media page (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, MySpace(hahahahaha yeah right, Tom))\r\n>2. E-mail addresses\r\n>3. Phone numbers/physical mailing addresses.\r\n>4. Any other personal information or \r\n>\r\n>**Any information pertaining to the user in real life cannot be used as evidence**\r\n>\r\n>>These rules are not only reinforced in the Court of Karma, but they are also enforced outside the Court of Karma in accordance with Reddit rules and general redditquette. Please respect everyone's privacy as it is unnecessary to publish information without consent. \r\n>\r\n>**Any Redditor who exposes or potentially exposes non-public personal information of any human on Reddit will get a ban.  No warnings, no due process.**\r\n\r\n###§ D. Bot Protection Act###\r\n>\r\n>>If a Bot is brought to Trial, a Judge or Justice may dismiss the Case if the Bot does not qualify for Exemption from the Bot Protection Act.\r\n>\r\n>>Exemption may be determined with the Asimov Two-Pin Test for Malice:\r\n>\r\n>1. The Bot was created with malicious intent.\r\n>2. The offending action(s) in question were intentional.\r\n>\r\n>>For a Bot to become Exempt from the Bot Protection Act of 2014, the Judge/Justice must determine that both of the statements in the Asimov Malice Test (or the AMT) are true.\r\n>\r\n>>The Bot Protection Act protects Reddit Bots from distress/malice from other Redditors. A Redditor may be charged with Bot-Abuse (or Bot-Negligence in #3 below) if they fall under any of the listed conditions:\r\n>\r\n>1. A Redditor uses the bot for Malice. (e.g. Abuses an exploit within the Bot's source code like in this thread [here](http://archive.is/K1oyO))\r\n>2. A Bot-Programmer creates a bot with malintent.\r\n>3. A Bot's Programmer refuses to fix a known bug/exploit, however, a Programmer who acknowledges an issue and is trying to fix it is exempt from Bot-Negligence.\r\n\r\n##ARTICLE. III. PROCESS FOR SERVING JUSTICE##\r\n\r\n\r\n###§ A. Filing of Charges###\r\n>\r\n>Plaintiffs may file any applicable charges (listed or unlisted) and bring their evidence before the court in the form of a post to /r/KarmaCourt. The Defendant can be served a summons, and attorneys can begin preparing their cases, but no charges are official until a duly appointed judge calls the case to order. Once charges are filed, both sides may request an attorney. Any redditor can serve as an attorney.\r\n>\r\n>>####§ A2. Finding A Judge####\r\n>>**Judges must have passed the bar exam to be judge.** Any KCA bar certified attorney can be a judge as long as they have participated in the KC community enough to know how it works. A month is the minimum:  \r\n>  \r\n>>If you´re really crap you will be removed.  \r\n>\r\n>>You have to make sure the case doesn't become inactive.\r\n>\r\n>>It is required that you are not a dick, or display dickish behavior as a judge.\r\n>\r\n>>The JUSTICES of KC retain the right to intervene in a case and take the judgeship responsibilities if they find a judge is not properly doing his/her job.\r\n>\r\n>>####§ A3. Finding an Attorney####\r\n>An attorney can be quite useful as they can assist you in representing yourself in the courts. They also are responsible for building a case against the opposing party and questioning evidence/witnesses for you. Any Redditor, as long as they have a good sense of procedures, can be an attorney. If anyone feels they need an attorney who has a considerable amount of experience in the courts, the Karma Court Attorney’s Office at /r/KarmaCourtAttorneys would be glad to assist anyone in need of an attorney. Redditors who are also interested in becoming an attorney can also go to /r/KarmaCourtAttorneys and become a K-BAR certified attorney either as a full, prosecutor, or defense.\r\n>\r\n>>####§ A4. Suggested formatting for the Stenographer\r\n>It is with great suggestion that the Court Stenographer maintain and follow the case records with great pride and diligence. An effective way of having a good case is to have effective formatting. A case should have a case number for record keeping. Listing the last two digits of the year, KCC, a dash with the two digit month, and a dash with the 5 characters from the URL found after the /comments/ portion of the URL. It would look like 13KCC-10-1VTG5. The stenographer would also include the description of the crimes committed, evidence, as well as members involved (Judge, Prosecution, Jury, etc). If the stenographer wishes to include news as well as any other information they feel that should be broadcasted, they may do so. Each stenographer has their own style of formatting.\r\n\r\n\r\n###§ B. ***Examples*** of Charges###\r\n\r\n>\r\n>There are many Karma Crimes that can occur while browsing Reddit.  The following are common examples of crimes.  Do not feel limited to these crimes only.  The overseeing judge has the final word in establishing a sentence. Charges remain open to interpretation to pertain to a case at hand.  The charges listed below are often used as a precedent for future accusations and to better understand the cases.\r\n>>\r\n\r\n\r\n>\r\n>(1). Douchebaggery - When one is being a douche.\r\n>  \r\n>(2). Defamation - Tarnishing another Redditor's username.\r\n>\r\n>(3). Public Indecency - When a user flexes his or her 'e-peen' with the intent to shame other users.\r\n>\r\n>(4). OhShit.exe - Intentional reposting that results in Reddit Gold.\r\n>\r\n>(5). GrandTheft.jpg - Reposting while claiming credit for the post.\r\n>\r\n>(6). Obstruction of Justice - Impeding or interfering with an investigation, such as submitting false screenshots, deleting evidence, or providing false evidence to the court.\r\n>\r\n>(7). Trying to make people believe some crazy ex kidnapped your cat definitely a no-no. Fuck that. GUILTY!\r\n>\r\n>(8). Other - Literally anything else you want.  We like creative names for charges.\r\n>\r\n\r\n\r\n###§ C. Sentences###\r\n\r\n>No punishments other than being publically shamed and being told you suck at Reddit or politely told to go fuck oneself.\r\n>\r\n>**/r/KarmaCourt is not here to downvote anyone, including those convicted, for anything other than irrelevancy.  Mass downvoting, as determined by a Justice, will be punishable with a ban, no warnings, no due process.**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###§ D. Case Abandonment###\r\n\r\n> i. A case is considered abandoned after two days (48 hours) of inactivity.\r\n>\r\n> ii. Any abandoned case is considered suspended indefinitely.\r\n>\r\n> iii. An abandoned case can be resumed by a Justice under circumstances they deem as \"dire.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n##ARTICLE IV. COMMON LAW##\r\n\r\n\r\n>Laws will arise from precedent. If a case arises where there is no previous ruling the outcome of that case becomes common law under the discretion of the Judges. Common law can be changed by the ruling of a judge, but doing so without proper reason can be used to file for appeal.\r\n\r\n##ARTICLE V. PROCESS OF EMENDATIONS##\r\n\r\n###§ A. Typographical Misguidings###\r\n>If you see a typo, just fucking tell us and we can fix it.\r\n\r\n###§ B. Application of Law Amendment###\r\n>The Mods of KC will bring forth a post to the court on the final day of any month with 31 days asking the community to air their opinions and if they suggest any amendments.  At that time, users may discuss amendments and potential changes.  This is to prevent users from constantly posting petitions in KC proposing amendments.\r\n\r\n##ARTICLE VI. LAW OF JURISDICTION##\r\n\r\n###§ A. Subreddit Independence###\r\n>\r\n>/r/KarmaCourt is an independent subreddit.  The laws of KC are loose and defined for KC only.  Any subreddit has its own laws.  Understand that the laws of KC cannot be forced upon other subreddits.  If a subreddit allows \"crimes\" that are illegal according to the constitution, then they cannot be tried here.\r\n\r\n###§ B. Applicable Subreddit Laws###\r\n>\r\n>Separate subreddit laws *ARE* chargeable.  If a subreddit that is NOT /r/KarmaCourt has banned memes, for example, but a user posts a meme there, it is can be an offense that is tried in KC.\r\n\r\n###§ C. Admin Extrication###\r\n>\r\n>Reddit Administrators are not required by any means to enforce any rulings of /r/KarmaCourt or intervene in any way.  Admins serve the same duty here, as everywhere else.\r\n>\r\n>Justices do not, will not, should not have Admin privileges or powers.  Do not ask the Admins, Justices, or other Redditors to grant this.\r\n>\r\n>**This court is a place for fun, silly, and straight up hard-core judgement, *NOT* a guillotine.**\r\n>\r\n###§ D. Fugitives###\r\n>\r\n>If a Redditor does not serve his or her sentence... Damn, oh well.\r\n\r\n\r\n##More F.A.Q.##\r\n*Can I be an attorney?*\r\n\r\n>Anyone can be an attorney in /r/KarmaCourt.  If you want more information or would like to become bar certified, check out /r/KarmaCourtAttorneys.\r\n\r\n*Do I need permission from the mods to start a case?*\r\n\r\n>No.  You can bring charges at any time.\r\n\r\n*How do I get post flair?*\r\n\r\n>OP of a case can add \"Judge Needed\" and \"In Session\" flair by clicking on the flair button underneath the post title.  Only Justices may choose the \"Case Closed\" flair.\r\n\r\n*What do I do if I have been charged with a crime?*\r\n\r\n>Run for your life.  Haha no.  Find yourself a good defense attorney and start finding evidence to exonerate yourself.\r\n\r\n*What is the Gazette?*\r\n\r\n>The Gazette, found at /r/KarmaCourtGazette, is the official newspaper for all things /r/KarmaCourt.  Like many newspaper's of our day, the Gazette has closed.\r\n\r\n*What is the KarmacourtBlog?*\r\n\r\n>The KCBlog, found at /r/KarmaCourtBlog, is the official media outlet for all things /r/KarmaCourt. Important information and high profile cases with up-to-date reports can be found here.\r\n\r\n*Where can I find a lawyer for a case?*\r\n\r\n>You have two options.  Either ask around in /r/KarmaCourt or head over to /r/KarmaCourtAttorneys and ask for one.  Look to the wiki page for a listing of KCA approved Law Firms.\r\n\r\n*Can I be convicted of a crime that isn't on here?*\r\n\r\n>Sure can.  The Constitution isn't a strict order.  It's a document that tries to portray how our court system works.\r\n\r\n*Is reposting a crime?*\r\n\r\n>No.  In itself, there is nothing wrong with a repost.  Chances are half the stuff you see on reddit for the first time on any given day is a repost.  Make sure that the crime fits before you press charges.\r\n\r\n*Why should I press charges?*\r\n\r\n>Because you're *internet bitter* and somebody stole your points that you can't cash in for anything.  It's all in good fun, but it's also fun to take things a little too far.  Key word, a little.  Just because you see a crime, does not mean you should report it.  There should be damages to you.  Nobody likes a whistle blower.  Or you can snitch, this is a document not a cop.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
